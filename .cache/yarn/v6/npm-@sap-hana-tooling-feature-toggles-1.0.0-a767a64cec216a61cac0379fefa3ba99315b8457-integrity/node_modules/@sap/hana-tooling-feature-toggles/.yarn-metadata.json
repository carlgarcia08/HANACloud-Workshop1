    "readme": "# @sap/hana-tooling-feature-toggles\nA node library for checking feature toggles. It gives you the option to create standard feature toggles and also feature toggles for Visual Studio Code commands.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Instantiation\n\nCreate an instance managing your feature toggles. The first parameter is the absolute path from your current file to a JSON file defining your feature toggles. The second parameter is the name of your Visual Studio Code extension (optional) if you want to enable / disable Visual Studio Code commands. The third parameter is a Visual Studio Code API object (optional). \n\nPure Node.js:\n\n```javascript\n    var FeatureToggles = new (require(\"@sap/hana-tooling-feature-toggles\"))(__dirname + \"/../featureToggles.json\");\n\n```\n\nVisual Studio Code:\n\n```javascript\n    const vscode = require( 'vscode' );\n    var FeatureToggles = new (require(\"@sap/hana-tooling-feature-toggles\"))(__dirname + \"/../featureToggles.json\", \"featuretoggletest\", vscode);\n\n```\n\nThe structure of your .json file (first parameter) should be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"featureToggles\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"helloworld\",\n            \"status\": \"released\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"helloworlddisabled\",\n            \"status\": \"dev\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"helloworldqa\",\n            \"status\": \"candidate\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe name is the unique identifier of your feature and the status determines whether it is in development, a candidate for release or a released feature.\n\n### API\n\n```javascript\n    FeatureToggles.isFeatureEnabled(\"featureToggleName\")\n```\n\nThis function checks if the feature 'featureToggleName' is enabled inside your specified .json file for feature toggles:\n- If the feature is enabled (for example 'helloworld' in the code above), it will return true.\n- If the feature is disabled (for example 'helloworlddisabled' in the code above), it will call _isFeatureQaEnabled(\"featureToggleName\") and return the internal result.\n\n```javascript\n    FeatureToggles.isCommandEnabled(\"featureToggleName\")\n```\n\nThis function should only be used if you are developing a Visual Studio Code extension and want to set feature toggles for commands. It will work like '.isFeatureEnabled(\"featureToggleName\")' with the difference that it will set a Visual Studio Code context variable which makes the command visible to the user.\n\nThe set Visual Studio Code context variable will be:\n```javascript\n    \"extensionName:featureToggleName\"\n```\n\nSo the package.json file of your extension should contain the following structure:\n\n```javascript\n\t\"contributes\": {\n\t\t\"commands\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"extensionName.commandName\",\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Hello World (enabled)\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t],\n\t\t\"menus\": {\n\t\t\t\"commandPalette\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"extensionName.commandName\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"when\": \"extensionName:featureToggleName1\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"editor/context\": [\n                {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"command\": \"extensionName.commandName\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"when\": \"extensionName:featureToggleName2\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## License\nThis package is provided under the terms of the [SAP Developer License Agreement](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_1.txt).",
