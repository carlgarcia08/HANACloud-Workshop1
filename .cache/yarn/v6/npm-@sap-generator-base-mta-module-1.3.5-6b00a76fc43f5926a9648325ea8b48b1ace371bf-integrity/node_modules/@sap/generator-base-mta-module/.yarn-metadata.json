Serves the use case where the path to the mta.yaml is known from the context.\n * mtaFilesPathsList - list of mta.yaml files. Serves the use case where the list of available mta.yaml files is known from the context. If the mtaFilePath option is passed, this parameter is ignored.\n * configPath - path to the configuration file. \n * defaultName - default module name.\n * targetFolderPath - path to the module target folder. Indicates where to generate the module folder.\n * relativeTargetFolderPath - path to the module target folder relative to the mta.yaml file, e.g 'app'.\n * addMtaId - add MTAID to module name: true or false(default). Only relevant if default module name is provided.\n * noTargetFolder - No folder module: true or false(default). Set this option to true if no content in the file tree should be generated for this module. This option overrides the “targetFolderPath” option.\n\n## Getting To Know Yeoman\n\n * Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).\n \n \n ## Release \n 1.1.5\n",
